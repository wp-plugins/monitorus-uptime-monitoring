Free Website Monitoring plug-in from Monitor.Us – monitor your blog’s uptime and performance 24/7 and see results in a web-based dashboard.

== Description ==

With the Free Website Monitoring plug-in from Monitor.Us you can ensure that you are the first to know when your blog is down or running slowly. You can also show everyone how stable and fast your blog is with our independent monitoring service. The plug-in periodically measures your blog's main page load time and uptime from checkpoints in North America and Europe. The results are available in chart form either from the Monitor.US web-based dashboard or from your WordPress admin dashboard. This plug-in also provides possibility to monitor your website directly from the plug-in settings page. Uptime and full page load monitors will be automatically created and placed on your website dashboard with default alert/notification settings. Checks will run every 30 minutes from locations in North America and Europe. You can also log-in to your Monitor.Us dashboard to have a unified view of all monitored websites/blogs and to view or amend notification settings.

Check results will be obtained from Monitor.Us by [REST API](http://www.monitor.us/api/api.html?adv=13812&loc=1).
